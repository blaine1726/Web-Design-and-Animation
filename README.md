Design/Animation Resources
==========================
A small list of design tools to make for more responsive, engaging web pages.

## Animations
###### Resources to make for easier web-development

#### [Three.js](http://threejs.org/)
An extremely powerful javascript engine for animations. Includes canvas, svg, webgl, and other tools.
In terms of speed, canvas and svg are preferable, but this tool shines most in its ability to make opengl development very simplified.
#### [GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)](http://greensock.com/get-started-js#tweenmax)
Probably one of the fastest javascript animation platforms. It invokes graphics acceleration within
the DOM elements in order to make the animations respond faster. This is used as a list of Tweens
and Timelines, in which a Timeline can sequentially animation a group of Tween animations. Each
Tween animation is treated as its own object to give you a very Object Oriented feel, and allows
for pausing, delaying, and playing animations very seemlessly.
