## Animations
###### Resources to make for easier web-development

### [Three.js](http://threejs.org/)
An extremely powerful javascript engine for animations. Includes canvas, svg, webgl, and other tools.
In terms of speed, canvas and svg are preferable, but this tool shines most in its ability to make opengl development very simplified. This is great if you want to use a built-in physics engine.

###### [canvas example](http://threejs.org/examples/#canvas_lines_sphere)
###### [webgl example](http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_gpgpu_birds)
### [GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)](http://greensock.com/get-started-js#tweenmax)
Probably one of the fastest javascript animation platforms. It invokes graphics acceleration within
the DOM elements in order to make the animations respond faster. This is used as a list of Tweens
and Timelines, in which a Timeline can sequentially animation a group of Tween animations. Each
Tween animation is treated as its own object to give you a very Object Oriented feel, and allows
for pausing, delaying, and playing animations very seamlessly.
This has a clear benefit over other animation platforms in that it works in all browsers (even IE).
###### Side note, this is probably my favorite resource to use for web animations

### [CSS3 3D](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_3dtransforms.asp)
Although most javascript animation platforms try to emulate the speed of CSS3 transforms,
nothing can quite beat the original. Although sometimes a bit tricky to use for advanced
animations, using primarily CSS3 transforms will allow for fast, mobile-friendly animations.

### GIF/Video
Unless something needs to be interactive, often times background animations are fastest just
as a video or gif. Just don't load up too many at once or else the load time of the page will
be longer, but in small doses these are very effective.
