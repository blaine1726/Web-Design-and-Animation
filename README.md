Design/Animation Resources

## Animations
###### Resources to make for easier web-development

#### [Three.js](http://threejs.org/)
An extremely powerful javascript engine for animations. Includes canvas, svg, webgl, and other tools.
In terms of speed, canvas and svg are preferable, but this tool shines most in its ability to make opengl development very simplified. This is great if you want to use a built-in physics engine.
###### [css3d example](http://threejs.org/examples/#css3d_periodictable)
###### [canvas example](http://threejs.org/examples/#canvas_lines_sphere)
###### [webgl example](http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_gpgpu_birds)

#### [GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)](http://greensock.com/get-started-js#tweenmax)
Probably one of the fastest javascript animation platforms. It invokes graphics acceleration within
the DOM elements in order to make the animations respond faster. This is used as a list of Tweens
and Timelines, in which a Timeline can sequentially animation a group of Tween animations. Each
Tween animation is treated as its own object to give you a very Object Oriented feel, and allows
for pausing, delaying, and playing animations very seamlessly.
This has a clear benefit over other animation platforms in that it works in all browsers (even IE).
###### Side note, this is probably my favorite resource to use for web animations

#### [CSS3 3D](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_3dtransforms.asp)
Although most javascript animation platforms try to emulate the speed of CSS3 transforms,
nothing can quite beat the original. Although sometimes a bit tricky to use for advanced
animations, using primarily CSS3 transforms will allow for fast, mobile-friendly animations.
These are best used as keyframe animations.

#### GIF/Video
Unless something needs to be interactive, often times background animations are fastest just
as a video or gif. Just don't load up too many at once or else the load time of the page will
be longer, but in small doses these are very effective.
____
#### [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
Simple css-only animations. Great for users who aren't very adept in using CSS transforms.
____
#### [Mozilla Animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Animation#Event_handlers)
This is a work in progress, but it shows a lot of promise for ease of use.
Generally anything that Mozilla develops works very well with web/mobile.
____
#### [Type.js](http://typejs.org/)
A small javascript framework for animating text to make it look like it's being typed.
____
#### [Autodesk Forge](https://forge.autodesk.com/)
This uses Three.js animations in order to display complex models in the web using Webgl.
Animations stay fairly responsive on mobile are and designed to work with the object types
made from Autodesk products, but the capability of the platform is pretty awesome. It can
do anything from on-the-fly designing to new VR technologies.
